            <p>In order to develop this project, Proyecto Esperanza would be contacting the Colombian justice department which is in charge of all the prison facilities in Colombia. Our judicial system has minimum security, middle security, and high security prisons. In this project we want to divide tasks in all three security level:
                Minimum security: most of this facilities are located in agreerian locations which would provide us the raw material (starch) to produce our bio resin
                Medium security: this facilities are location on middle sized cities and the power energy in this small cities tends to be cheaper so this means that we could provide equipment to produce the bio resin pellets and the film to produce the bag
                High security: this in my opinion is the most valuable of inmates population in Colombia most of this prisons are built and run by the government of the united states due to this fact they are the most organized and developed facilities and would be perfect for packing and distribution
                Families of the inmates, of all security levels, would be in charge of running the collection of used bags classification and logistics to take the used bags to be used as fertilizers in hills where the agricultural activity takes place.
                I am convinced that not only we can produce income for the inmates and their families, but also reduce the use of  plastic products in Colombia.

                <li><p><b>What are the constitutional rights, if there are, for the inmates and how does it affect
                    them?</b></p>
                    Everybody, without any exception, nationals and foreigners, that are in national
                    territory, enjoy constitutional rights. Fundamental rights that acquire their relevance in
                    the legal world since the Constitution of 1991 in which application is over any other
                    actual normativity in the legal order.
                    The fundamental rights of Colombians are found in Title 2, First Chapter from article
                    11 to 41 of the Political Constitution of Colombia of 1991, which gives us a total of 31
                    fundamental rights ( without counting those for connectedness ).
                    Lets remember that not all prison populations are in the quality of condemned, this is,
                    with a sentence on behalf of the judicial operator executor. A big part of the prison
                    populations are simply in syndicated quality, lets say, that over them, lays a measure
                    to ensure appearance at trial of an intramural trial until the criminal process ends.
                    Another part is found only in the condemned sentence in first instance waiting to be
                    resolved in the resource of an appeal or extraordinary cassation and finally those that
                    are deprived of liberty those with a condemned executory sentence, solely for the
                    purpose of serving his sentence.
                    With that being explained, it's possible to establish that independently the condition of
                    the person ( national or foreigner, man, woman or other identity, prisoner or a free
                    person ) the fundamental rights that are plasm in the Political Constitution, are of
                    mandatory application for the State authorities and for particulars. This way, with the
                    right of life in article 11 Constitutional up to the free development of the ibid
                    personality, has to be recognized to the one that has the condition of recluse.
                    Evidently in Colombia, its guaranteed the right of freedom in multiple expressions,
                    however the same, by Constitutional dispositions and in the exercise of the faculty
                    ius puniendi of the State, that right can be limited always and when precepts are
                    verified like the one of legality ( procedures and motives previously established by
                    the law ) and by the order of the competent authority.
                    In that order of ideas, it is sensitive to manifest that the prisoners in Colombia are
                    susceptible of being subjects of observancy to certain constitutional rights or by
                    connection with other rights such as health, conjugal visits, human dignity, free of
                    expression, intimacy between others, that with the action of tutelage, can be an
                    object of verification by any judge of the republic in effects of a vulneration of
                    cessation , grievance of his observancy of his constitutional rights and therefore an
                    order will be given to the competency to protect those fundamental rights.

                <li><p><b>The history of imprisonment remain in the register? Will this affect their access to
                    education, medical attention, work etc?</b></p> 
                    At this point various topics are established.
                    <ol><li>The history of imprisonment is a very ample concept that integrates, like it
                    was mentioned before, people that are deprived from freedom by diverse
                    motives. This way, depending on the stage in which they prisoner is, the
                    competent authority, in this case the INPEC, will maintain a permanent
                    register of the people that are active in the prison establishment and like
                    those that already served their sentence or their freedom was given because
                    of other reasons.</li> 
                    <li>Nevertheless, it is understandable that the question has a sociocultural tint
                    because of the opportunities of education, medical attention,work among
                    other things, of those who act like free people before being deprived of liberty.
                    In that sense, these aspects are aboard by the articles 159 to 162 of the
                    Penitentiary Code where in one of the articles it establishes â€œ Sentence
                    served, the criminal background cannot be by any motive, a factor of social or
                    legal discrimination and cannot show in the certificates of conduct that are
                    given.
                    Thus, if it's of existence a registry on behalf of the officials of the State about
                    the background of a person, the same will be a part of a reserved information,
                    and the certificates of conduct required, there should be no historical
                    evidence in effects of discrimination acts.</li> 
                    <li>Lastly, in relation of the scheme of health for the population deprived of liberty,
                    its regulated by Decree 2245 of 2015, in the development of the articles 65
                    and 66 of law 1709 of 2014 and modified by the Decree 1142 of 2016, in
                    which articulates the affiliation of this population to the General System of
                    Social Security on Health for those who can conserve their affiliation to the
                    contributive regimen , special or of exceptions and to the subsidiary regimen
                    for the domiciliary population that cant access the previous regimens. Law
                    1709 of 2014, Decreets 2245 of 2015 and 1142 of 2016; Resolutions 4005 of
                    2016 and 5512 of 2016.</li> 
                    </ol>
                    <p></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Can they vote if they have criminal records?</b></p>
                    <p>Whoever is paying an imprisonment cannot vote. Once the person pays for the time of
                        imprisonment, they can vote again. Clarifying the Constitutional Corte through sentence
                        T-324 of 1994 that â€œ the detainees that have not yet been condemned , are beneficiaries of
                        the presumption of innocence and for political effects, must be considered like citizens with
                        all their rights which deserve a preferred deal because they are in an inferiority situation.

                <li>
                    <p><b>How do you think this affects the family?</b></p>
                    <p>This is more of a sociological case than juridical, nevertheless, the studies have shown that
                        the family affectivity depends on who is deprived of liberty.We find that those who have no
                        family and pay their incarceration in absolute solitude or on the contrary the ones that have a
                        whole structure conformed by love ones that help the condemned, surpass this stage.In thai
                        second group of people, you can observe affectations not only in sentimental way by seeing
                        a love one deprived of his liberty of locomotion, but additionally, economic observances
                        specially in those families that depend on the income of the inmate; psychological and moral
                        affectation, academic performance of the children, among other situations.
                        Among these points, it is recommended to consult with a psychologist that treats these
                        aspects in a deeper way</p>
                    <p></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>What are the legal obstacles for the inmates to get a job and go back to society?</b></p>
                    <p>In this section it is precisely to mention that the penalty in Colombia does not have a
                        vindictive purpose because of the crime caused. By the contrary, its purpose, as seen on
                        article 4 of Law 599 of 2000 ( Penalty Code) looks for the general prevention, jura retribution,
                        special prevention, social reinsertion and the condemned protection.
                        Although written in the norm, that is far away from reality, more thankfully to the presence of
                        stigmas from society and political ignorance, the reintegration becomes difficult on the
                        execution of the sentence served, like the acts after the sentence.
                        Like jails with a very high crowding index and reiterated ignorance of constitutional rights of
                        the jail population, a lot of times in conditions of special treatments, prevents the inmate from
                        atoneting his conducts and reframe the way he acts in society.
                        From this point of view, if the jail population presents high indices of recidivism, let's say has
                        been through jail once or more times, that indicates that the resocialization is not fulfilling
                        and that there is a population that by a diverse factor, is more susceptible to go back to the
                        center of reclusion. From the previous you can conclude that on a shy way from the reasons
                        mentioned, in Colombia the resocialization in prisons does not put far away for crimes to a
                        considerable number of jailed population and there is an existence of a type of population
                        that by diverse factors ( specially economical and socially) is more susceptible to go back to
                        prison. This indicates that the penal system operates in a selective way over a particular
                        group of people. That then generates in the society, a constant thought of who were
                        condemned, generating a distrust for who was condemned in a jail. Clearly this raises
                        barriers in the obtaining of jobs, housing and intrafamily relations. That is why Colombian law
                        gives the no manifestation of certificates of conduct over an imposed penalty, in the effect of
                        preventing this type of finger pointing and barriers that are object to people that are
                        condemned.

                <li>
                    <p><b>What are the legal obstacles that prevent the prisoners reintegrate to society?</b></p>
                    <p>Speaking properly of one legal obstacle would be irresponsible. It must be recognized that in
                        a big measure, the law has looked into avoiding the discrimination of people that have
                        served time in prison and are looking into reintegrate back to civil society. Meanwhile, the
                        case, more than legal, obeys to a cultural problem, let's say on behalf of those that observe
                        from the outside.
                        This wat, to avoid the segregation of this group of people, there is a need of education for
                        the same Colombian population and with them, make them aware that resocialization is a
                        joint labor where the State interacts, the imprisoner and the members of the society, in the
                        effects of obtaining a harmony in the structure o dynamic of the associates.</p>
